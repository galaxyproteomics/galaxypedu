**Galaxy-P platform for multi-omics analysis!**

_Galaxy-P is a multi-omics informatics platform. The focus of the platform is integrative analysis of genomics, transcriptomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics data. Galaxy-P is an extension of the popular Galaxy bioinformatics platform, and is being actively developed by the Griffin research group at the University of Minnesota in collaboration with the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute.  The project is funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Cancer Institute’s Informatics Technology for Cancer Research program._

_In order to extend the reach of these workflows to the greater community, the Galaxy-P team has partnered with both the [JetStream cyberinfrastructure resource](http://jetstream-cloud.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com){:target="_blank"}._
